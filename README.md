# InstallSoftwareRemotely
PowerShell script for remote software deployment

This is a copy of a PowerShell script created by JuanGranados which was originally in TechNet Gallery - https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Install-software-on-9278d883

I created a copy of it here as TechNet Gallery is closing down soon and the script works so well I didn't want it to be lost, quite happy to remove it if original creator moves it to GitHub himself in future

Below text copied from original posting:-
